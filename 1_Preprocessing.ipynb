    "# Reverse optimization of school preferability parameters under MNL choice model\n",

    "As part of my research into admissions markets, I model student preferences using the multinomial logit choice function, which assigns each school a preferability parameter $\\delta_c$. Then, given a set of admitted schools $C^\\#$, students attend school $c$ with probability $$\\frac{\\exp \\delta_c}{\\sum_{d \\in C^\\#} \\exp \\delta_d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When all schools use a common ranking over the students and admit students whose score exceeds a certain percentile $p_c$, then the demand for (percentage of students choosing to attend) school $c$ is given by the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_c(p) = \n",
    "\\sum_{d=c}^{|C|} \n",
    "\\underbrace{\\frac{\\exp{\\delta_c}}{ \\sum_{i=1}^d \\exp{\\delta_i}}}_{\\substack{\\text{prob. of choosing  }\\\\ c\\text{ from assortment}}} \n",
    "\\overbrace{\\left(p_{d+1} - p_{d}\\right)}^{\\substack{\\text{prob. of having}\\\\ \\text{assortment }C_{[d]}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we assume the schools are ordered by cutoff ($p_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq p_{|C|}$), and we take $p_{|C|+1} \\equiv 1$. $C_{[d]}$ refers to the admitted school set consisting of the first $d$ schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question asked here is, **given the demand for each school and its admissions cutoff, can we figure out the market's underlying preferability parameters?** This is not an easy question, because while school's publish their admissions rates, these cannot be taken as any indication of overall preferability, because not all students apply to every school.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, we need some data to play with; since the assumption that all schools use a common ranking is itself unrealistic, I haven&rsquo;t  fretted too much about the details&mdash;this is just a proof of concept.\n",

    "Let's make the unrealistic assumption that each school admits every student whose SAT math score exceeds what the school has reported as its 25th percentile SAT math score.

A more accurate way of doing this would be to run principle component analysis over student data and use the first principle component as the common score.)\n",
